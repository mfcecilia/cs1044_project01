Sample	input	and	corresponding	output


This	program	will be	run	interactively;	the	user	should	be	prompted	to	enter	an	integer and	then	
your	program	will	produce	another	integer	depending	on	whether	the	input	was odd	or	even.	


The	following	is	an	example	of	what	you	might	see	when	you	run	the	program; the	input you	
type	is shown	in	*italics*	(press	Enter	at	the	end	of	a	line),	and	the	output	generated	by	the	
program	is	shown	in	bold text.


Enter an integer: *123* <br>
Number is odd, doubling each digit in the integer...<br>
Result: **112233**<br>
Would you like to enter another integer (y/n): y<br>
Enter an integer: *456*<br>
Number is even, tripling each digit in the integer...<br>
Result: **444555666**<br>
Would you like to enter another integer (y/n): y<br>
Enter an integer: *124*<br>
Number is even, tripling each digit in the integer...<br>
